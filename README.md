# Data_Scraping
Data scraping using beautiful soups

## Introduction
In the digital age, data has become the backbone of informed decision-making, especially in sports analytics, where performance insights can significantly influence strategy. Web scraping, a method of extracting structured data from websites, empowers developers and analysts to gather up-to-date information without relying on manually curated databases. This project demonstrates the use of 
Python, particularly the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries, to scrape historical hockey statistics 
from scrapethissite.com. The goal is to automate the extraction of team statistics, such as wins, losses, 
goals for and against, and compile them into a clean, structured dataset for further analysis or 
visualization. 
By targeting the HTML elements of the webpage and parsing them systematically, this project 
showcases how unstructured web content can be transformed into a usable format like a CSV file. Such 
capabilities are especially useful in sports journalism, betting analytics, or fantasy league insights, 
where time-sensitive data can make all the difference. Ultimately, this exercise not only hones web 
scraping techniques but also reinforces the value of automation in data science workflows and lastly, 
an effective way of learning by seeing actual results 
The objectives of the assignment were: 
1.  Practical Python coding on Jupiter Notebooks hosted on Google Colab
2.  Use requests and BeautifulSoup to extract data from a web page.
3.  Parse and clean the extracted data.
4.  Store structured data into a Pandas DataFrame.
5.  Export the final dataset to a .csv file.
